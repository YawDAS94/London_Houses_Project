# London_Houses_Project

This is a project where I use python to analyze the rising costs of rent in London
I looked at compound annual growth rates per year (CAGR) and ratios of price movements between 2018 and 1998

The skills I used were the following:
A) using pandas & matplotlib
B) data ingestion and inspection 
C) exploratory data analysis 
D) tidying and cleaning 
E) transforming DataFrames & subsetting DataFrames with lists 
F) filtering DataFrames, grouping data, and melting data (wide to tall table)
G) advanced indexing 
H) using fundamental data types & dictionaries 
I) handling dates and times 
J) function definition, default arguments, variable length, and scope 
K) lambda functions and error handling
